# HFact - Fact++ Haskell bindings

# Building

The project is built with
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). You need to provide
the path to the `fact` library:

``` bash
$ stack --extra-lib-dirs=/path/to/libfact build
```

The library is generated by the Makefile target `fpp_c`.

# Usage

``` haskell
import HFact

main :: IO ()
main = do
  kernel <- newReasoningKernel
  sourceConcept <- mkConcept kernel "http://www.example.com/ontology/basic#ClassA"
  strSubConcepts <- getElements1D =<< getSubConcepts kernel sourceConcept All
  mapM_ putStrLn strSubConcepts
```
